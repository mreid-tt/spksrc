# GitHub Actions CI/CD

SynoCommunity uses GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and publishing of packages.

## Build Pipeline Overview

### Pull Request Builds

When you submit a PR, the CI system automatically:

1. **Detects Changed Packages** - Identifies which packages need building
2. **Builds for All Architectures** - Creates SPK files for supported platforms
3. **Runs Basic Validation** - Checks package structure and metadata
4. **Uploads Artifacts** - Makes build outputs available for testing

### Package Detection

The CI determines which packages to build by:

- Checking files changed in the PR
- Following dependency chains (if `cross/libfoo` changes, all packages using it rebuild)
- Respecting `UNSUPPORTED_ARCHS` settings

## Workflow Files

### Main Build Workflow

Located at `.github/workflows/build.yml`. By default, packages build for DSM 7.1 and DSM 6.2. DSM 7.2 builds are opt-in and require setting `TCVERSION=7.2` as a minimum in the package Makefile.

### Build Matrix

Packages are built across multiple architectures:

| Architecture | Typical Hardware |
|-------------|------------------|
| x64-7.1 | Modern Intel/AMD |
| aarch64-7.1 | ARM64 (DS923+, etc.) |
| armv7-7.1 | Older ARM (DS218, etc.) |
| x64-6.2 | Intel/AMD (DSM 6) |

## Build Actions

### `.github/actions/build.sh`

The main build script handles:

```bash
# Package-specific build
make -C spk/${PKG_NAME} ARCH=${ARCH} TCVERSION=${TCVERSION}

# Dependency-based full build
make -C spk/${PKG_NAME} dependency-flat | xargs make
```

### Cache Management

To speed up builds, the CI caches:

- **Toolchains** - Cross-compilation toolchains (large, shared)
- **Distrib** - Downloaded source tarballs
- **Wheels** - Pre-built Python wheels

Cache keys include architecture and version to prevent conflicts.

## Triggering Builds

### Automatic Triggers

- **Push to master** - Builds and publishes release packages
- **Pull requests** - Builds for validation (no publish)
- **Workflow dispatch** - Manual trigger with custom parameters

### Manual Builds

You can manually trigger builds from the Actions tab:

1. Go to **Actions** > **Build**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select branch and optionally specify packages

## Artifact Retrieval

### Download Build Artifacts

After a successful PR build:

1. Go to the PR's **Checks** tab
2. Click on the build workflow
3. Scroll to **Artifacts** section
4. Download the SPK files for your architecture

### Artifact Naming

SPK artifacts follow the pattern:

```
{package}_{arch}-{tcversion}_{pkgversion}-{spkrevision}.spk

# Examples
transmission_x64-7.2_4.0.5-11.spk
python312_aarch64-7.2_3.12.4-6.spk
```

## Publishing Process

### Automatic Publishing

When PRs are merged to master:

1. Packages build against release configurations
2. SPK files are signed (if configured)
3. Packages upload to the package repository
4. Repository index regenerates
5. Users see updates in Package Center

### Manual Publishing

For maintainers with repository access:

```bash
# Build release package
make -C spk/mypackage ARCH=x64 TCVERSION=7.2 PUBLISH=1

# Upload to repository (requires credentials in local.mk)
make -C spk/mypackage publish-arch-x64-7.2
```

## Debugging Build Failures

### Common CI Issues

**Architecture-specific failures:**

- Check `UNSUPPORTED_ARCHS` in package Makefile
- Review architecture-specific patches
- Examine cross-compilation flags

**Cache-related failures:**

- Stale caches can cause issues
- Request cache clear from maintainers if needed
- Check for `.done` marker file issues

**Timeout failures:**

- Large packages may need workflow timeout increase
- Consider splitting into smaller components

### Viewing Full Logs

1. Click on failed job
2. Expand the failing step
3. Click "View raw logs" for complete output
4. Search for `error:` or `Error:` patterns

## Best Practices

### Before Submitting PRs

1. **Test locally** on at least one architecture
2. **Check dependencies** - ensure all are available
3. **Verify PLIST** - all files properly listed
4. **Test install/uninstall** on real hardware if possible

### PR Hygiene

- Keep changes focused - one package per PR
- Update changelog and version appropriately
- Respond to CI failures promptly
- Don't force-push after review starts

### Monitoring Builds

- Watch for dependency chain failures
- Monitor build times for regressions
- Report infrastructure issues to maintainers
